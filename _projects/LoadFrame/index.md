## Overview
I designed and built a custom 4-column load frame in SOLIDWORKS to test the mechanical strength of parts and assemblies in tension, compression, and bending. The design went through several iterations, starting with a 2-column system, but limitations in the stepper motorsâ€™ force capacity led to a shift toward a 4-column design for greater load capability. The system integrates stepper motor drivers, Arduino Unos, OLED screens, load cells, amplifier boards, and SD card modules to enable real-time display, and accurate data logging for post-test analysis. By fabricating all structural components through 3D printing, I significantly reduced costs compared to industrial testing machines while maintaining functionality. My First design revolved around using a linear actuator to pull on a sample directly connected to a crane scale. This initial design had similar data logging to version two except version one used a slider pot to measure a rough displacment of th esample before ultimate faiulure occured. However, it had major drawbacks since the maximum load was around 100 lbf and there was no speed control.
