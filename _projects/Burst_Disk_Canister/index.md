## Overview
Designed and developed a Burst Disk Canister for Cyclone Rocketryâ€™s piston ejection system to improve the reliability of black powdered burning at high altitudes. The canister was modeled in SOLIDWORKS CAD, with radial O-ring seals versus the previous gasket-based design. Structural integrity was analyzed using SOLIDWORKS FEA and verified with hand analysis of thick-walled pressure vessel calculations. Multiple iterations were created, each progressively smaller while maintaining performance. Hydrostatic testing was conducted for each design to validate proper sealing and predictable burst disk activation at the desired pressure.
