## Overview
Overview & Description:
Designed and developed a Burst Disk Canister for Cyclone Rocketryâ€™s piston ejection system to improve the reliability of black powder ignition at high altitudes. The canister was modeled in SOLIDWORKS CAD, incorporating radial O-ring seals to replace the previous gasket-based design. ANSI tolerancing standards were applied to ensure proper fit and sealing between the O-rings and mating components. Components were CNC milled and lathed to precise specifications. Component strength was analyzed using SOLIDWORKS FEA and verified through hand calculations of thick-walled pressure vessels. Multiple iterations were developed, each progressively smaller while maintaining performance. Hydrostatic testing validated proper sealing and predictable burst disk activation at the desired pressure.
