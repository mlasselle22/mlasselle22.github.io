## Overview
I designed and built an L3 high-powered rocket, using OpenRocket to predict flight performance and guide structural decisions such as fin thickness and material selection to prevent flutter and divergence. To ensure fin strength, I reinforced the fin section with carbon fiber composites. I prepared and presented a detailed technical briefing to my TAPS for project approval and developed a complete bill of materials and purchase orders to procure all necessary components. Critical flight components, including aluminum bulkheads, were designed, CNC milled, and optimized through FEA analysis to achieve a high strength-to-weight ratio capable of safely withstanding flight loads. The rocket is scheduled for its first flight within the next six months.
