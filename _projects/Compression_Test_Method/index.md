## Overview
During my Summer 2025 internship, I developed and implemented an improved compression testing method for FDM 3D printed materials. The company's current method used ASTM D695-10 which defines yielding as a zero slope on the stress-strain curve, but many FDM materials do not exhibit a clear zero-slope region, leading to inconsistent data. I programmed a yield offset method in MTS TestSuite TW Elite and implemented it on a MTS Criterion Model 43, replacing the zero-slope criterion with a more reliable and accurate approach for 3D printed materials. This method improved material data accuracy and consistency, reduced technician involvement, and shortened sample preparation and 3D printing time.
