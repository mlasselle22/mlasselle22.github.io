## Overview
I simulated the rocket’s flight profile and stability in OpenRocket to guide my design choices. A full CAD assembly was created in SOLIDWORKS to ensure proper component fitment and design. The rocket was manufactured using a custom 3D printer with the parts having carefully tuned wall thicknesses and infill orientations to maximize mechanical strength. Material selection was tailored to specific loading conditions — for example, carbon fiber nylon was used for couplers to handle bending loads between rocket tubes. Ground tests validated pressurization-based separation, confirming that parachutes could eploy reliably and that structural components could withstand the required forces. I later improved on version 1 of the rocket by using even stronger materials and further weight optimizing the rocket to reach greater speeds and altitudes.
