## Overview
I designed and built a custom 3D printer to achieve performance beyond low-cost hobbyist machines. The system was fully modeled in SOLIDWORKS, utilizing linear rails for improved precision and motion control, and displacement-driven design was considered for the gantry. I developed custom G-code routines to enable advanced functions such as automated nozzle wiping and optimized kinematics. The printer was fabricated from cost-effective aluminum extrusions, CNC Milled brackets and 3D-printed components. Performance was validated through thermocouple testing of platen heating. Mechanical performance was verified through tensile and compressive testing of printed parts, while nozzle flow capacity and print quality assessments confirmed consistent and reliable extrusion.
