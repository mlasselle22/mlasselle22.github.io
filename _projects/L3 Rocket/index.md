## Overview
I designed and manufactured a L3 high-powered rocket. I leveraged OpenRocket to predict flight performance and guide structural decisions such as fin thickness and material to avoid fin flutter and divergence. I prepared and delivered a comprehensive technical presentation to my TAPS for project approval, while also developing a complete bill of materials and purchase orders to procure all necessary components. Critical flight elements, such as aluminum bulkheads, were designed and CNC milled in-house out of aluminum, and FEA analysis was performed to optimize their strength-to-weight ratio, ensuring the bulkheads could safely withstand the high loads encountered during flight.
