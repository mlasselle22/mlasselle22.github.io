## Overview
I began the project by modeling a rough flight profile in OpenRocket to verify passive stability. A collaborative CAD model of the rocket was built in Onshape, designed so that all structural components could be 3D printed. To evaluate aerodynamic forces, I performed CFD simulations in SOLIDWORKS on the fins, varying control surface angles, velocities, and angles of attack. These results will later be used to estimate the true control authority of the rocket. On the embedded systems side, I developed the PID control algorithm and established direct servo actuation. Although the rocket has not yet undergone flight testing, a test launch is planned within the next six months.
