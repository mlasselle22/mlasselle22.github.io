## Overview
I earned my Level 2 (L2) high-powered rocketry certification, which authorizes the purchase and use of J, K, and L impulse class motors. The certification process required passing a written exam covering rocketry, physics, and safety, as well as designing, building, and launching a personal rocket with a safe recovery. To meet these requirements, I designed my rocket in OpenRocket with an emphasis on aerodynamic stability, constructed the airframe from fiberglass tubing for strength, and CNC-milled aluminum bulkheads to secure the couplers and add hardpoints for the shock cord to attach to. I performed ground tests to validate parachute deployment and recovery systems before the flight. On certification day, the rocket launched on a high-powered motor, achieved stable flight, deployed its parachutes correctly, and was safely recovered, completing the certification successfully.
